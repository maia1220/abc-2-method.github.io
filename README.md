## 🔬 About the ABC/2 Method

The ABC/2 method is a validated bedside estimation technique for intracerebral hemorrhage volume.

**Formula:**

Volume = A × B × C / 2

Where:

- **A** = Maximum length (cm)
- **B** = Maximum width at 90° to A (cm)
- **C** = Height  
  (Number of CT slices with hematoma × slice thickness, typically 0.5 cm)
